Did either method converge to a probability?

	Yes, in query1 both methods converged to a probability, as can be seen in Project6Analytics.pdf. The steadily decreasing variances
	demonstrate an increasing accuracy of prediction.
	In query2, the sample size was too small for rejection sampling to be effect. There simply weren't enough consistent networks generatted.
	Likelihood weighting, however, converged to a probability in query2 as well. This is because likelihood weighting constructs only consistent
	networks.

Was there any difference in the convergence rate?

	Yes, in query1 likelihood weighting converged to a probability more quickly than rejection sampling. In query2, likelihood weighting was the only
	approach to converge to a probability within the given number of samples.

Explain why

	Likelihood weighting performed better than rejection sampling because it is specifically designed to address the issue of too many samples being
	rejected. Likelihood weighting generates only consistent bayes nets, accounting for this choice by weighting the resultant nets by their likelihood
	of occurring naturally. Likelihood weighting converged faster because it didn't have to reject inconsistent nets, and was thus able to use all the nets 
	it generated.
